# ship-destroyer
A challenge set by our coaches at Nology to demonstrate being able to use arrays and array iterators. 
This challenge had a time limit and we were restricted to 1 HTML file to do all our HTML and Javascript in as well as a 150 line limit. 
I won a tech award based on this as I had a working product in just over 90 lines of code. 

## Tech  Stack 
* Javascriipt
* HTML

## Still to do 
* As this was timed css was not prioritised so I would make another file and add style to it 
* fix a small bug I have with it showing (dead before taking them out of the array)

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in live server
